        $post->content = "<p>There’s no denying it, creating a memorable event or meetup can be a task all in itself. Ensuring your audience not only is aware of your event’s time and location, but additional ensuring they receive value for their attendance. During the planning stages, it’s a great idea to come up with a narrative to keep everyone in attendance engaged.</p><p>In this article, we are going to discuss how to create an awesome narrative for your event or meetup.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Know Your Audience</strong></h2><p>The first step to creating a good narrative is to know your audience. Answering the following questions will significantly help you in reeling in the attention and engagement of your attendees.</p><p>• Who are your attendees?&nbsp;</p><p>• What is your gathering type? An event, a meetup, a conference?&nbsp;</p><p>• When is your gathering being held? - Day vs. evening&nbsp;</p><p>• Where is your gathering being held? - In the office, a restaurant, or event center&nbsp;</p><p>• Why is this gathering being held? - Is there a conflict in the workplace, are you presenting a new product?</p><p>Once you have the answers to these questions it’s time to create a clear message for your attendees, what you’re looking to accomplish during the event and what your end goals are.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Who Will Be Attending</strong></h2><p>Understanding your audience begins with knowing who will be attending your event. What is their background, their goals, and what part do they play in your overall design of your event. Are you dealing with executives, marketing teams, or employees of a department within your company? You can customise your narrative to fit the individuals who will be present for a relatable experience.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>What Is Your Gathering?</strong></h2><p>Defining the type of gathering will provide you more insight into the best methods of executing your narrative. Are you presenting at a large scale conference or event where you hope to make connections with potential clients or customers? Or is this a meetup consisting of employees or co-workers? The size of your gathering may determine how extensive your narrative needs to be. For smaller groups, you may be interested in packing as much information as you can into a single narrative, whereas with larger scale groups you may want to touch base on the core values and allow for additional exploration for the finer details.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>When is Your Gathering?</strong></h2><p>Take advantage of the time of day in which your event is taking place. Is it early in the morning where the addition of coffee and breakfast foods may provide more of a stronger impact? The potential energy level of your attendees at certain points of the day should be taken into consideration as you build your narrative to catch their attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Where is Your Gathering?</strong></h2><p>Location, location, location! Having a great presentation in place is only as good as the location. Take advantage of your surroundings to give your gathering that extra bit of OOMF. Include themed decor or marketing materials to give your gathering additional character and make it more relatable to your audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why is Your Gathering Being Held?</strong></h2><p>The purpose of your gathering is perhaps one of the most important components as it brings all of the other points together. With a clear and specific establishment of the goals you are aiming for during your gathering, you will be able to provide a narrative that perfectly melds together your message, while additionally keeping your audience engaged.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>The Technology</strong></h2><p>In today’s digital world there are a million and one variations of the same technology and software that aim to achieve similar goals. Finding the right technology to bring your narrative to life can seem overwhelming at first, however, we have the ideal solution with EventGo a white-label software solution for all of your event and meetup needs.</p><p>With EventGo you can gamify your event to capture your attendee's attention, increase engagement, and make it not only fun but memorable.

        $post->title = 'How Gamification is Changing the Way We Interact with the World Around Us';
        $post->content = "<h2><strong>What is Gamification?</strong></h2> <p>The advent of gamification in all aspects of our career, businesses, social lives and leisure is rapidly on the rise. You may have heard of the word gamification and you may even be able to sum it up with a sentence of phrase. Loosely, the term applies to adding game design elements and game principles to non-game contexts. However, gamification has much deeper connotations than this, encompassing a wide range of psychological and scientific components which could have significant ramifications on the industries that are impacted by its application &nbsp;</p><p>The concept behind gamification is to enhance the overall experience for people who are engaged in activities that wouldn’t normally be associated with gaming. This is done through leveraging our desires to seek out achievement, rewards and status. By working towards an overarching goal that can be easily quantified through gamification, we can at the same time tap into our competitive nature.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>An Example of How Gamification Works</strong></h2><p>Take for example goal setting. If I had a goal to make it into the gym each morning, five days a week, I would have to battle with all the inner thoughts, excuses and doubts as to why I should keep going. Eventually I might lose interest altogether and focus on something else leading my goal to turn into a failure. Now if we were to apply gamification to this goal, let’s say through an app, I could turn this into a quest of sorts. There are a few apps that currently exist that work in this way. The more you are able to work towards a habit, the more “skill points” your character would gain. As you gain more skill points, you unlock more options and customisations for your character. Some apps even let you set certain rewards which would be unlocked at certain levels of your achievement such as going out to an extravagant dinner if you were able to keep your gym attendance up for a whole month.</p><p>For someone who struggles to find the time and effort to make it into the gym, gamification allows them to change their focus. Your thoughts go from being associated with the pain of having to workout, getting up early in the morning and making an effort to drive to the gym to being associated with unlocking greater, more quantifiable rewards. This could be in the form of bonus points, levelling up their character and achieving short term goals.</p><p>This is just one individual example of gamification. While it might help you understand the definition of gamification a little better, it barely scratches the surface as to how widely used gamification is and how many facets of our lives can be integrated with game design elements.</p><p>The reason gamification works so well is that your brain is hardwired to seek out rewards and release dopamine when those rewards are being attained. Conveniently, games are designed around the achievement of rewards and therefore by gamifying tasks, goals and actions in your life you can essentially engineer the results you want your brain to seek out and derive pleasure when those results are achieved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Gamification within Event Planning</strong></h2><p>Another example of how gamification is being used by businesses is through the gamification of events. This is a refreshing shift in the way events have been traditionally held and can leave attendees feeling as though they have achieved something meaningful when the event is wrapped up. One major example of how gamification has been used in events is through the use of event apps. Attendees are able to download an app which offers information on the event as well as games which greatly increase users adopting the app and engaging with the event. Furthermore, through using these event-based gaming apps, users are able to have a heightened feeling of satisfaction and achievement associated with the event.</p><p>Another element of gamification at events is by offering a Leaderboard for all attendees to view. This has been applied to networking or expo events where attendees are given scores based on how well they engage with other attendees or stalls at the expo. The scores are then listed on the event website or through the app for all to see. By providing these types of incentives, attendees experience increased feelings of competitiveness, desire for status on top of the leaderboard and the heightened energy that comes with engaging with the event in a meaningful way.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Should My Business Consider Using Gamification?</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, gamification has been around for quite some time. It wasn't until recently that gamification increased in complexity, overall adoption and awareness which has resulted in many companies integrating gamification to many aspects of their marketing, products, training and design.</p><p>The fact is that gamification is changing the way we interact with each other and the world around us. The companies that are able to stay ahead of the curve and use gamification to their advantage, engaging with their consumers in a way that develops long term relationships, will ultimately derive a greater level of customer and employee loyalty in the future.</p><p>Gamification has virtually unlimited applications, many of which we are only just beginning to explore. It offers an exciting new way to leverage our competitive nature and boost our willingness to achieve in settings that would previously be unremarkable. Gamification offers marketers and businesses a way to utilise the strengths of our audience in a positive and engaging way that works for both parties. From what has occurred over the last decade, there is a clear incentive for bringing in much loved game design mechanics and adopting it throughout our everyday lives in our work, leisure, health and communication.</p><p>If you are curious as to how gamification can be applied to your events, EventGo offers a simple and intuitive way to gamify your attendees’ experiences while building brand loyalty.</p>";

        $post->content = "<p>In today’s business, it is imperative to have real-time analytics in place. With the increase in momentum of analytics, the gathering of real-time data has grown significantly in both popularity and necessity. The option to monitor users habits provides valuable insights into what can and should be done to increase conversation rates.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Knowing your target audience has proven results</strong></h2><p>The most common example of this instance is online purchases. Often customers will place items in their cart with the full intention of purchasing later, however, the purchase steps are less frequently completed. Through data analytics, online vendors have been able to track these habits and amend their strategy to include a pop-up reminder notification to increase the likelihood of customers continuing with their purchase.</p><p>Through the use of real-time analytics, vendors were able to increase sales and retain customers. When looking at the success of an event, the use of real-time analytics is key. The idea is if we can make strategy amendments from an online perspective and see an increase in conversion, how much more engagement could be obtained from gathering real-time data during a high-priority event?</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Real-time analytics increase engagement</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;Real-time data gathered during events provides the following benefits</p><p>1.
